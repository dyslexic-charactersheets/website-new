You'll need to subscribe (at the $1 minimum rate) and log in using your Patreon account to get the benefits.\nFull editing has been the #1 requested feature in all the years I've been building these. It was only made possible because of the way the new Pathfinder 2e sheets are built - which, sadly, means it doesn't apply the Pathfinder 1e, Starfinder or D&D 3.5e character sheets.\nWhile these new features are only for patrons, the character sheets themselves are as free as they always have been. Accessibility features and translations are also free. For a breakdown of exactly what's free and what's reserved, see the Patrons page.\n(*) Not all the classes and archetypes are fully calculated yet, but most of them should be."

        "body": "I've seen rumours that One D&D won't be getting a OGL.\nIf you're not familiar with it, the Open Game License is a legal document that permits anybody to use the D&D rules in their own publications provided they respect their intellectual property. It's what allows third-party publishers to make adventures and other content for the game, it's what allows games like Pathfinder to exist, and it's what allows me to make character sheets legally.\nThe openness of the game has spawned a great deal of the creativity that's blossomed in the RPG space. Without it, D&D would not be the commercial success it is now.\nIt sounds like WotC sees all this money going to other people and want to get that for themselves. The move into the digital space, with the purchase of D&D Beyond and the development of their own VTT, indicates that they want to own the whole D&D experience. If true, this is a short-sighted decision, both for WotC and for the hobby as a whole.\nI have no insider information. I don't know if this rumour is true.\nBut I do know that, without a legal framework, I could not make character sheets for it. Nor would I want to."

Just how worried, angry and betrayed it made us feel.\nD&D is more than just a property that a company can own. It's a folk game, and a whole community and identity built around it. It's the product of countless people, some of them working for the hundreds of publishers, or the thousands of part-time creators, but most of all it's the many players and DMs who've made this game what it is.\nIt seems obscene that a profit-seeking company could have control over it, and more so that they could choose to take the whole thing away.\nThat nightmare was averted this time, due to the speed and scale of our reaction. Executives honestly didn't expect the reaction they got - because they don't actually know anything about the players or community. Just think on that. This catastrophic course of action was taken by people who don't care enough to get to know the people it affects.\nAnd it wasn't even smart greed. I'm used to greed - I live in capitalism the same as the rest of you. It was incompetent, self-defeating greed, that wouldn't even have served their business interests even if it had worked entirely according to plan. And those idiots are getting million-dollar bonuses now.\nI'm not going to replay the events of the crisis blow-by-blow. I expect you'll see plenty of that in the next few days. I just want you to remember why it mattered."
